# Password Generator
Password Generator is a Python GUI application developed for educational purposes by a TomorrowDevs student. This tool allows you to generate customized passwords based on the desired length or characters deemed most suitable.

# How does it work?
Make sure you install the necessary dependencies that will make the project work properly. Use the following terminal command:
```sh
pip install -r GUI_APP\requirements.txt
```
To run the program, make sure Python is installed on your system application, clone the repository and launch the application using the command:

```sh
python GUI_App\main.py
```
After that a graphical interface will open that will allow you to interact with the application. At this point follow these steps:

1. In the top right corner, you will find a slider bar to select the desired length for your password;
2. Below the length bar, you will find several boxes corresponding to different characters (numbers, uppercase, lowercase, symbols). Check one or more boxes to include the types of characters you prefer in your password;
3. At the bottom of the window you will find a central button called "Generate Password". By clicking it, you will generate a new password every time. 
4. To view your password, check the box on the left that says "Show Password".

Remember:

- The password length must be greater than 0.
- At least one character type box must be checked to generate the password.
- Make sure to check "Show Password" to view the generated password.
